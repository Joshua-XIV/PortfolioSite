          Hello! My name is Joshua but usually just go by Josh.  I'm a big nerd at heart and have a huge love for all things math, science, and gaming related. 
          Whether it's diving into complex equations, or geeking out over cool new tech and games. That curiosity naturally led me to programming, which started as a fun hobby back in high school. 
          Over time, it became something I wanted to pursue more seriously, so I began expanding my skills and diving deeper into the field. 
          I'm currently based in the United States, particularly in the Austin region, and Iâ€™m always eager to explore new technologies and continue growing my knowledge.
